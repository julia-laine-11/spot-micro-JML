This is the part where I learned that parts matter and you can't always just buy the cheapest and fastest equipment, especially when you want it to work properly.

Overall, I used 4 different servos:
- MG996R from Amazon
- MG996R from Amazon (different seller)
- MG996R from Aliexpress
- PDI-HV5523MG

Sell me bad servos once, shame on you. Sell me bad servos twice, shame on ~~me~~ you again.
