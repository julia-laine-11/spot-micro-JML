Hi! 

I started this project once I saw [these files online](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) and that it used an Arduino. With my newly found amazement for microcontrollers, I was determined to make this.

I began by printing all of the files. I used the MG996R version of the files.

*I just love this yellow color*

I also ordered servos. The cheapest ones possible. How could that possibly go wrong!? 

I began assembling it. I used all of the default parts listed (Arduino MEGA2560, MG996R servos, HCsr-04) before I knew any better to make personal upgrades.

*continued assembly... yeahhh thats a tiny breadboard inside there, and default Arduino wires. Definitely suuuuppperrr reliable... nothing could go wrong with that!*

After assembly, I began working on the code and the wiring.
