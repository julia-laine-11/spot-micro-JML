# spot-micro-JML
this is my progress on my robot :) I am just a student so it isn't the best but I am having a great time learning as I go.

I lost access to my old account, so I am remaking the repo on here since it was private on the last one and I can no longer see it.

I started this project in 2020 or 2021. Through this project, I became interested in engineering, and now I am a junior in EE at Purdue. With this- it's definitely obvious that I am learning as I am going and there are definitely more optimal ways to do what I have done.

First off, the cad files I used are from here:

I am using this repo to learn more about ROS:

And this book also:
 Programming Robots with ROS: A Practical Introduction to the Robot Operating System 1st Edition by Morgan Quigley, Brian Gerkey, William D. Smart

I have put my work in sections with images since this is more documentation for my future self than functional code. While I wish I had functional code, I have limited time to work on my robot with school and work. :)
