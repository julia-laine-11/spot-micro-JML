At the same time as I was trying to get my servos working, the legs kept breaking.

*broken legs*

This might have been because I was bad at printing (see below), it might have been because the part was thin, or it might have been that I didn't use enough walls / infill.

*yes that is all glue on the bed. im not sure what i was doing*

I made [this file](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4875204) to replace the current legs. I tried PETG, but that was more fragile and I returned to PLA later. All I did was add some extra material to where the pieces were breaking and call it a day. I still use these legs now, and none have broken 😊👍.
