Hi! 

I started this project once I saw [these files online](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) and that it used an Arduino. With my newly found amazement for microcontrollers, I was determined to make this.

I began by printing all of the files. I used the MG996R version of the files.

*I just love this yellow color*

I also ordered servos. The cheapest ones possible. How could that possibly go wrong!? 

I began assembling it. I used all of the default parts listed (Arduino MEGA2560, MG996R servos, HCsr-04) before I knew any better to make personal upgrades.

*continued assembly... yeahhh thats a tiny breadboard inside there, and default Arduino wires. Definitely suuuuppperrr reliable... nothing could go wrong with that!*

I tested each legs code individually. I had the robot sitting on a flower pot, but it was too short so I hung him from the ceiling. Now that he was assembled he had way more personality so I named him Newt ([like this little fellow](https://www.gertjanverspui.com/eu-species-list/amphibians-of-europe/salamanders-newts/)):

*everyone always asks "oh! newt like isaac newton?" and the answer is no. unfortunately I am both not clever enough to think to name him after a famous scientist, and too stubborn to change his name now.*

Anyways, here he is hanging from the ceiling like a very strange disco ball:

At this point, he was powered from the wall. I had learned earlier that I could not power 12 servos from the Arduino or else it gets unhappy. My incredibly cheap backup MEGA2560 I got from Aliexpress or something did not like to do more work than it was meant to do, and it let the magic smoke out. I am not sure why I did not see that coming, because it made sense the second it happened.
