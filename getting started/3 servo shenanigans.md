This is the part where I learned that parts matter and you can't always just buy the cheapest and fastest equipment, especially when you want it to work properly.

Overall, I used 4 different servos:
- MG996R from Amazon
- MG996R from Amazon (different seller)
- MG996R from Aliexpress
- PDI-HV5523MG

Sell me bad servos once, shame on you. Sell me bad servos twice, shame on ~~me~~ you again. It was pretty disappointing to recieve fake servos in the mail 3 times, but hey, 4th times a charm?

## MG996R (first batch)

So the description of the CAD files say these servos fit nicely into it. I thought "perfect! I'll order those! People online would never lie to me and sell me fake servos!"

I ordered the servos labeled "all metal gears" and name brand "Tower Pro"

This is what I recieved:

Techincally it was metal gear (with no s) so they didn't fully lie. The only problem is my dog was eating these up with his incredible weight of four pounds.

He wasn't eating up the gears though. The chips inside couldn't handle the current they said they could and they were burning out. So, I was sad but ordered *slightly* more expensive ones online, hoping for real gears *and* chips.

## MG996R (second batch)

Hoping for both real gears *and* chips was too much to ask. I got super excited when the new servos arrived since I immediately cracked them open and found fully metal gears.

I thought everything was stellar until I had the same issues with the chips blowing out. I made "franken-servos" (as my mom called them) by ordering more of the chips that went into the servos to replace them. I re-soldered the chips and the servos worked well.... for a bit. They had the same issues. So: either both chips were fake or the chip just wasn't cut out for the work it was advertised to be able to do.

## MG996R (seller's official listing)

Angerly, I did more research to find where the actual manufacturer sold the servos. Unfortunately, they only sold in bulk on their official website (and 12 is not bulk ðŸ˜ž) so I ordered from Aliexpress or Alibaba on their official page. I am not sure why I fell for the trap 2 times, but you live and you learn I guess?

The newest servos were absolutely beautiful. They had better screws, better gears, better assembly, and more durable wires. I *thought* everything was set.

Nothing blew up this time, but the servos were just not strong enough. They would run as much as possible an then just collapse when they had too much of a load. They continued to work though, even when pushed to their limits. They just were not good long term since Newt could not recover from slipping or bending too much with these servos installed.

## PDI-HV5523MG

I finally discovered there was a [community around this robot](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and I joined the Slack & Discord to see what other people were using for their robots. On there, I learned about PDI-HV5523MG. I saw videos of robots that used them and I did research + talked to people who used them to see if they were right for my application. 

I excitedly and nervously ordered these servos. I currently use them in my robot. They work well and I am happy with them.
