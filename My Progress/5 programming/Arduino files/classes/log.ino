5/13/21- Destroyed everything then recovered most
       - Lost sit/stand/walkRF/walkLF
       - 10/10/21 -its okay though because those were garbage

8/16/21- Lost new arm angles by not saving because that's how I roll
       - Added an updated walk

8/22/21- 4 new adafruit mg995r servos.
       - tlb, trb, mlb, mrb now are swag servos B)

8/27/21- 12 adafruit mg995r servos
       - Wow they are actually functional!!!

10/10/21- created turn function(s) [turnL();]
        - I lost some data from the school resetting my computer, I'm not sure what I lost though so it obviously wasn't too detrimental.
        - Created more tabs to minimize chaos since having 1 tab was literal hell to scroll though

10/11/21- I am officially Boston Dynamics itself. Using spotClassTeset.ino, I am able to be all powerful and use spot.walk(); instead of the
            feeble and lowly walk(); that only losers use. 
        - The location is (C:\Users\Jay\Documents\Arduino\classSpotTest) so I don't forget it later. I have also uploaded it and all its glory
            to my Google Drive.
        - I also uploaded all my code (including this file) to Github so when I'm stupid and get my computer reset again I'll be okay.
