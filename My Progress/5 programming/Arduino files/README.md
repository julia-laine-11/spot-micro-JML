These were preliminary tests. I no longer use them. 

Reading old code is like digging through a dusty closet. I do not know why I did some of the things in here, but I was learning as I went so it is okay.

It's not the most efficient, it's not the prettiest, but I did have fun and learn a lot.

I began taking a coding class in the middle of making these files. 

As I review these, I realllyy wish I documented my work better. I definitely do now but I am not sure why I did not previously, haha.
