# Programming

This is the part I was not the most excited about. While I wasn't quite dreading it, I just didn't do this project for the purpose of coding it. Now, this project has evolved into a programming heavy project and it teaches me new things every time I work on it.

## Arduino Beginnings

I started out by using an Arduino MEGA2650. Each leg had a run loop, and I ran the diagonal legs at the same time with a pause for the other diagonal legs. It also stopped when something was closer than 8cm to either ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) on the front. It was okay. It sure did wobble a lot, but it was exciting.

## The problem with Arduino

Although exciting, the Arduino was not powerful enough. Who would have guessed inverse kinematics would be difficult! (Not me in high school, since I had never heard of it or anything like it!). I read various articles and realized I was in over my head a little bit. Online, I saw other people were using ESP32s, Raspberry Pis, Jetson Nanos, and custom microprocessor setups. While I was really scared to use a RPi since I knew nothing about it, it looked like the best option for me.

## Raspberry Pi

I ordered a RPi 4B, but I got a whole kit with a keyboard, mouse, and book in the mail. That was pretty cool and also super useful. I used an old TV for my monitor and I tried to install ROS from scratch. It was my first time using Linux so of course I messed stuff up. I did learn a lot though and whenever I made irreversible errors by experimenting with what it could do, I just wiped the SD card and reinstalled Ubuntu 20.04.
